            Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation is prevalent in urban microclimate studies. This study examines two popular CFD microclimate simulation software, ENVI-met, and ANSYS-fluent, through comparison and experimental validations. We used the Taipei climatic conditions from the weather station as a boundary condition for both software. The findings show a high coefficient of determination of air temperature and relative humidity between experimental measurement and simulated results. However, other details, such as the porous media effect and the overestimated radiation in the two tools, were inconsistent when comparing the radiant temperature. Results demonstrate that researchers should select an appropriate tool depending on the study’ aims.},
